# How to start to contribute in project step by step

I have distribute this project into three main parts for contributers :
| steps         | About         | Time  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| First step    | Creat a home page of a wrbsite | 10 - 15 days |
| second step   | buit an game and add on the website  |  15 - 20 days |
| Third Step    | Implementation for multipalyer & Rooms | 30 - 40 days |
| Final step    | Debugging and basic change if needed | 10 - 15 days |

### Firts Step -

Creat a landing page (Home Page) by using frontend development

_Detail:_ The first phase of a project is the most straightforward because all that is required of the contributor is to copy our designs (this is especially important if their designs are better than our designs) and create a landing page (or home page), which serves as a direct conduit between the user's browser and our website. The initial phase of the project is crucial because if users don't feel at ease using our website, they may quit using it completely, which is negative for our website. All contributions would have been utterly useless if this happened. in order to improve the responsiveness and dynamic experience of our users.

### Third Step - 

Here you are creat a room for players where the meat with different players

_Detail:_ Thiird step is hardest part of project acording to me. I have to find one random online user and transfer real -time data netween both of them . you all are familar with whatsapp when we are chatting with our friends under the hood whatsapp will transmit messege from one socket to anotner but when it comes to group chatting transmitting message from socket to sockot is not efficient so whatsapp creats a room it has a unique ID and inside that all socket will be there here messege transmit from socket to rom i am going to use this room's conapt to build this game 
let's take an example user clicks on play we redirut into game main page where we give two options. 

**play with stranger.** 

**play with friends.** 

when users click on play with stranger button i will sand a room creat even from the frontend on the backend i will creat a room with a unique ID and join the user in that room to join another player in this room  i need room ID so i have to save room detail somewhere.I will save room ID in a array called room if another user clicks on that button first i will checj there any room available from that array if the room is available i will make this user to join the room is an issue here.

I only ewent towi player to join ths room to fix this i will add avariable calledvaccent to check if the roon is avariable or not to have a track of player info like socket ID option ,option scora and option lock will savr data  in player object now i need to sand this detail to the frontend we rea sending a room gate even from the backend  i hope you undrestood what i said now talk to play with friend button , sharing a link i will take the room ID from that link and check if is there any room available with a given ID if there a room exit then i will check if its availableand vacant then user can join the else i will redirect him to the home page currently any user can join the room if"s awakend .To save this i will current a prive rooms for those who click on a play with the friend button .
